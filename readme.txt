This is Solarus, the open-source A-RPG game engine.

This Windows binary package contains:
- Solarus: The executable file of the engine. Run it with the path of
  your quest as argument (the directory containing data/ or data.solarus
  or data.solarus.zip).
  Without this argument, the current directory is used as quest path.
- A sample quest. This is a very minimalist example of game with only one map
  and almost nothing to do, but you can run it or edit it.
- Solarus Quest Editor: An editor that helps you create maps and tilesets
  for your quest.

See our website www.solarus-games.org for more information, to learn how to create
a quest or to download our games or the source code of the engine.

Enjoy!
